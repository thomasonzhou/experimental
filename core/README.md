# Core

This is an library for robotics, computer vision, and deep learning.

Some design decisions:

- all matrices are floating point (rgb, grayscale, depth map) for consistency across inference, preprocessing, precision, etc.


# TODO

- fp approximation
- basic algorithms

- least squares
- gaussian kernel
- CUDA
- pybind


- onnx
- tensorrt
- mujoco

- consider protobuf lite
